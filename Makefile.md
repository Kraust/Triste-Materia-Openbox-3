# Triste-Materia-Openbox-3
Triste theme based on [addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections](https://github.com/addy-dclxvi/openbox-theme-collections) using a Material Design Dark color palette.

I wanted an Openbox 3 colorscheme to go with [NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme](https://github.com/NLKNguyen/papercolor-theme) so I made one. I don't expect anyone else to find value in this unless you really like Openbox + nvim-qt.
